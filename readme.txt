No complex apps, plain and simple, just text...

Directory structure, scripts and text templates used to implement a 
simple planner scheeme. 

Using this is simple: you can clone the repo (or download it as a zip) 
and use the templates provided to set up your directory organization 
in your own machine. And if you need to create new template files 
or manipulate your own planner files. 


Please note: This scheeme works for me, I have been using it for 
a couple of years now and it has evolved quite a bit.
