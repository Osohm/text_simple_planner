SipText - Text Simple Planner
=============================

No fancy apps, plain and simple, just text...

Directory structure, scripts and text templates used to implement a 
simple planner scheeme. 

Using this is simple: you can clone the repo (or download it as a zip) 
and use the templates provided to set up your directory organization 
in your own machine. And if you need to create new template files 
or manipulate your own planner files you can use some of the scripts 
provided or write your own.


Please note: This scheeme works for me (I certainly hope it works for you too), 
I have been using it for a couple of years now and it has evolved quite a bit.
