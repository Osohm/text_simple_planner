Notes Templates
===============

This repo simply holds the default directory structure and text 
files which I use as templates to plan and manage my tasks.

While I am using some nice Markdown conventions for some of the 
text files, this is purely for visual purposes. You should use 
the files as just plain and simple .txt files. 

With a few exceptions and that is if it applies to you, everything 
has been kept in text files. Except for:

* Spreadsheets for calculations: I am using an open document spreadsheet, 
    but you can also use a CSV file.
      
If you don't need to do calculations get rid of the spreadsheet directory.

* Xournal for inkpad hand drawings: I am using a xournal file to make 
diagrams or quick drawings. 

If you don't have a drawings tablet (i.e. with digitizer and/or touch 
screen) you can remove the inkpad directory.
